## CSAT - What’s That?

### Presented by: Betsy Roseberg


**CSAT**: Customer Satisfaction


#### Use customer comments to improve your documentation
* When customers provide useful data, research it, confirm, and then improve the documentation.
* Use the customer data to update documentation, even if the only info provided is a Yes or No answer to whether the document was useful.
* User comments can be used to clarify your documentation, even if the doc was technically correct. For example, add a note to a document to call-out or clarify a topic.


#### CSAT is an absolute necessity to determine if customers are satisfied.
